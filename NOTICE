## AI Assistance Acknowledgment

This project was bootstrapped with assistance from the OpenAI `o1-preview` model.
It was used to scaffold basic types and encoder/decoder functions according to [RFC 7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).
Manual edits were made to adjust the generated code to the actual Gleam language and to fix compilation errors.
Captured assistance session could be found in commit messages.

Other AI models from different providers were used to provide suggestions, generate initial code structures, and assist in problem-solving during the early stages of development.

It's important to note that while AI assistance was used, all final decisions, implementations, and the overall direction of the project were determined by human developers.
